# Why I recommend E2E testing over unit testing on websites

---

End-to-end (E2E) testing and unit testing are both important methods for ensuring the quality and functionality of a website, but they serve different purposes and have different strengths. E2E testing is focused on testing the entire system, including all of its components and interactions, while unit testing is focused on testing individual units or components of the system.

E2E testing is particularly well-suited for website testing because it allows for testing of the entire user journey. This includes all of the interactions that a user would have with the website, such as navigating through different pages, filling out forms, and submitting data. This type of testing is especially important for websites that have complex interactions and workflow, as it allows for the detection of issues that may not be apparent when testing individual units or components.

E2E testing also allows for the detection of issues that may arise from the integration of different components. For example, a website may have multiple forms that are integrated with a database and an email service. If a unit test is performed on each form separately, it may not reveal any issues. However, when performing an E2E test, it can reveal an issue that arises when the forms are integrated with the database and email service.

Another advantage of E2E testing is that it allows for testing of the website's performance under real-world conditions. Unit tests are often performed in a controlled environment, which may not accurately reflect the conditions under which a website will be used. E2E testing allows for the testing of the website's performance under a variety of conditions, such as different browsers, devices, and network speeds, which can help to identify and fix issues that may not be apparent during unit testing.

E2E testing also allows for the detection of usability issues. By testing the entire system, it is possible to identify areas of the website that may be confusing or difficult to use for users. This can be especially important for websites that are intended for a wide range of users, such as those with disabilities or limited technical knowledge.

On the other hand, unit testing is mainly focused on testing individual units or components of the system. This is typically done by writing test cases that exercise specific functionality and verifying that the results are as expected. Unit testing is an important method for ensuring the quality and functionality of a website, but it is not as effective as E2E testing in identifying issues that may arise from the integration of different components or from real-world usage.

In conclusion, E2E testing is an important method for ensuring the quality and functionality of a website because it allows for testing of the entire user journey, detects issues that may arise from the integration of different components, allows for testing of the website's performance under real-world conditions, and detects usability issues. Unit testing is also an important method, but it is not as effective as E2E testing in identifying issues that may arise from the integration of different components or from real-world usage. Therefore, it is recommended to use both E2E testing and unit testing together to ensure that a website is fully functional and user-friendly.
