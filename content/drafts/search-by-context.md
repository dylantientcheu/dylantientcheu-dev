# Querying and finding using Context

---

It is often said that "content is king," and in today's digital age, that statement is more true than ever before. With so much information available online, it can be difficult to find exactly what you're looking for. This is where the concept of "search by context" comes in.

## What is "search by context"?

Search by context refers to the idea that the context in which a piece of content is presented can be just as important as the content itself. In other words, the way in which information is organized and presented can greatly impact its discoverability and usefulness.

## Why is it important?

One of the main reasons why search by context is important is because it allows for more accurate and relevant search results. When a user conducts a search, they typically have a specific goal in mind. However, traditional keyword-based searches can often return irrelevant or incomplete results. By taking into account the context in which a piece of content is presented, search algorithms can better understand the intent behind a user's query and return more accurate results.

Another benefit of search by context is that it can help to make information more easily discoverable. In the past, information was typically organized in a hierarchical manner, with the most important information at the top and less important information further down. However, this approach can make it difficult for users to find the information they're looking for, especially if they're not sure where to start looking. By organizing information by context, it becomes more easily discoverable, allowing users to find what they need more quickly and easily.

Search by context also helps to improve the overall user experience. When users can easily find the information they're looking for, they are more likely to return to the site and engage with the content. This can lead to increased user engagement, higher conversion rates, and ultimately, greater success for the website.

Finally, search by context allows for better personalization. As search algorithms become more sophisticated, they are able to take into account a wide range of factors, including the user's location, browsing history, and search history. This allows for a more personalized search experience, with results that are tailored to the individual user's needs and preferences.
